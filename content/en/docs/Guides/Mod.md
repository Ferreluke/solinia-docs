**INSTALLING THE MOD FOR FALL OF AN EMPIRE**

NOTE: You require the latest version of forge to use the mod and play on our server.

Please download forge for your version of minecraft at https://files.minecraftforge.net/

Open the forge.jar file to install it, and when prompted choose "client".

You can then install our mod in your .minecraft directory

Our mod is available from https://github.com/mixxit/solinia3-ui/releases

Please download the Solinia3ui.jar file, not the source code.

To access your .minecraft directory, press (Windows) + R and type %appdata%\.minecraft and press enter.

Then place the downloaded mod into the "mods" folder.

If there is no "mods" folder, create one labeled "mods" and place the mod inside.

Congratulations! Close and reopen Minecraft and you should be able to log onto our server!
