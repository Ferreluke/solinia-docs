Emperor Val'Esir

Ruler of the Caerthian Empire during the Mythological Age and the Time of Crisis, Emperor Val'Esir is a pure blood Sun Elf of the lands of Qylia. He oversaw a bitter rivalry with the Aerindal Kindgdoms of the North, invading them twice during his leadership

# Noteable Campaigns

## Aerindal

It is believed Val'Esir oversaw a propagander campaign forcing the Ophidians to invade Caerthain territory as a justification for Caerthian evacuation and expansion north into Aerindal territory. Paying the Ogres a large sum to invade the Keladun and Aerindal whilst simultaneously blaming brutalities on caerthian refugees the Caerthians began a war into the lands of Aerindal and conquered the city of Eindel

It was during this period that the Aerindal drifted into the pages of history, had it not been for the return of future travellers into the past, the Aerindal would never have been seen again

## The Caerthians Invasion of Amaria

Following the death of Methabeht and the shattering of the Time Line, races found the future and the past merged in some unkown land known as Amaria. Seeing the Aerindal alive once more the Emperor began a grand campaign once more to crush not only the Keladun and recently escaped Anushi slaves, but the Aerindal once more

It was during this campaign that Emperor Val'Esir took the advice of a mysterious sage known as Shai'Din who gave him the where abouts of a tomb containing a powerful weapon known as Hiran Asura. Using this weapon he launched a final attack on Eindel but was ultimately killed in the process as Shai'Din turned sides with the defenders and led the evacuation of Amaria from the Caerthains

## Death

Emperor Val'Esir was murdered by the lich Shai'Din in the final moments of the Eindel siege during The Caerthian Invasion of Amaria in 1234 P-OE (196982 UT)

# Family Name

Val'Elsir is believed to be a word that represents the city of Cal'Drin and was discovered by the Caerthians in the subterranean areas of the appropriated city. 

The name (and in particular the throne) was adopted by the earliest dynasties of the Mysmaal many years after the fall of the Caerthian Empire

# Deuzulus

It is believed that Deuzulus was once a prince of the Caethian Empire and also carries the Val'Esir name, though he has long since discarded any of his former self since his elevation to God of Hate
