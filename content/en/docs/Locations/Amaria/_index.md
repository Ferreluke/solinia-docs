Amaria is an archipaelo that snakes across the far south east of the planet Solinia. The island chain itself is currently undiscovered by most races of Solinia. Due to the sizes of the islands and the peculiarity of its position on the planet there lays a variety of topical features from wind swept deserts to frigid icy plains.
