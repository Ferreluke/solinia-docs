**Description**

Bards have a unique combination of abilities, making them extremely versatile. Essentially a bard is a cross between almost all the basic classes. The key function of the Bard is to sing songs on repeat, buffing or healing their party as they choose. They're not the best damage class, but they'll whittle you down as they mez you and run faster than light away.
