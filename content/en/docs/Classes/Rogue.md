The rogue is a dps class and has the highest melee damage,it can use both sword and bow with deadly poisons that deals damage or debuffs 
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
At lvl 4 you learn dodge, 12 safefall (negates fall damage),13 dual wield (chance to hit with the item in the second hand),16 double attack, and 30 riposte (chance to counter the attack of the enemy). 
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
The sneak works just don't look at the mobs.
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
This class has few spells at the starter levels the first one you can buy it at level 1 and it's throw stone, the second one it's Elbow strike at lvl 5 and the third one it's backstab at level 10.
These spells all deal damage to a target. Then we have 
Focused will discipline at level 10, (in theory you can have only one discipline active but this feature isn't added yet) 
This spell heals you every tick but all these spells for me are not worthy to buy except for backstab, then you have at level 20 the spell sneak attack that adds the critical chance, the hit chance, the critical damage and the hit damage, then you have up to lvl 30 and one to lvl 40 2 others discipline 
Resistant discipline that increase all the resistances of 20 and fearless discipline that increase the chance to counter fear spells 
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
All of these spells can be bought from haven[x -104;z 384],morheim(from the rogue guild hidden in there)[x 235; z 267],arndal[x 918;z 274],olvasound[x -276; z -391] 
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
The next spells up to level 59 can be found by killing: oshira rake; oshira ravager; oshira reaver(at the fear dungeon garuda chick(At hoakar) 
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
Meanwhile the spells up to level 65 can be found by killing : garuda avenger; garuda rook(At hoakar) cleansed soul(At infernal cathedral) 
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
Most of the spells are like sneak attack but with different modifiers, one of the most versatile skill a rogue can have is rogue ploy lvl 61 this skill can mez up to lvl 65 for 30 seconds.
