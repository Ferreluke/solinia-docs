{{% /pageinfo %}}
The Garuda are bird like creatures of varying colours and breeds that worship Amonsul, the God of Defense and Protection. They are friendly and warm to outsiders and are known for their ability to divine events occuring far into the future. They are sensitive to the spirit realm and nature in general and are often found to be druids and shamans. Originally The Garuda come from a land they refer to as Sierra Miwok which they were forced to evacuate many centuries ago. The Garuda are locked into an eternal struggle against the Gialon due to an event that occured in the distant past
