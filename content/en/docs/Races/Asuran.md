Fallen Angels with origins in the Dead Age, the Asurans are the result of Hiran Asura's campaign of death which wiped out most of the life of Solinia for thousands of years

## Playable Race

This is currently a playable race

## Additional Information

### Facial characteristics

Dark purple, browns and black skin, a twisted angel appearance

### Biology and appearance

The physical appearance of an Asuran is not unsimilar to their Tinai counterparts (who resemble winged humans). Asurans can take on many different physical changes as a part of their infernal departure from their celestial brethren. These include bat or raven like wings ranging in number from 2 to 6, and in colour from black and red to pure flame. Some older Asurans can develop small horns not unlike those of Fauns. Asurans often have deep shadowed eyes either ice blue, pitch black or red. An aura of hatred, darkness, or flame surrounds the stronger Asurans

## Personality

Asurans are an incredibly aggressive group of beings. They often take great joy in the injuring and death of other beings which causes them to be off-putting to other races. To most other races, including their own former kin, they are the embodiment of pure evil and hate. Often times they will even attempt to kill off their own comrades should they see them as below their own level. They, more often than not, are ready and willing to leave behind those who are unfit and unready for their military lives. Cold and calculating Asurans are one of the few races truly born and raised for war

All Asurans are of the Evil category

### History

#### The Original Timeline

Fallen Angels were first created when Hiran Asura revived the Angels that fought against him. He then enslaved these Angels mentally using his magic, and thus they follow his every whim, acting as his army. However, over time Hiran Asura began losing his grip on their minds for unknown reasons, enabling some to free themselves of his influence and openly rebel.
