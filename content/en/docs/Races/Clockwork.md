Clockwork
{{% /pageinfo %}}
The Zahnfe are a race of clockwork beings, living in pockets around Tosteladt. They are unique among the mechanical races in that they don't consume fuel of any sort, only needing their springs wound. The small, faerie like ones can be wound by hand, but the high-tension springs in the man sized ones are usually wound using the torque from a waterwheel. As such, most Zahnfe settlements involve a river. Worthy of note is that no Zahnfe can wind the spring of another of their own size. The tension needed is simply too much, if they could wind each other they would be perpetual motion engines.
